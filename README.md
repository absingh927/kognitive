## Running locally

Clone the repo and run`yarn` from the root directory and then go to `/client` folder and run `yarn` to install client side dependancies.

Run `yarn dev` and that will start up the server and client side app.

**Note**: `dotenv` has been used to load enviornment variables like and store app key.
